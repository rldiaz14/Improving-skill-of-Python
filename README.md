# Improving-skill-of-Python

My name is Ramon Diaz, a graduate student at Southern New Hampshire University.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Game Programming and Development, which has sparked
my interest in programming languages, especially Python. Through my studies, 
I have come to appreciate the versatility and power of Python in the field of
machine learning and AI. As a result, my goal is to continue to learn and practice different
programming languages to expand my skill set and become a well-rounded developer.

I am seeking to enhance my skills in Python in order to complete my final project of building a Twitter bot. 
Improving my proficiency in the language will allow me to efficiently code the necessary functions and algorithms
for the bot to function properly. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the language will enable me to troubleshoot 
any issues that may arise during the development process. I am excited to apply what I learn to this project 
and see the final result of my efforts.

I have found the use of the OpenAI tool ChatGPT to be an invaluable resource in my journey to improve my programming skills in Python. With its ability to provide clear and concise explanations and examples, ChatGPT has helped me to better understand complex concepts and apply them to my project. Additionally, its ability to understand and respond to natural language input has made the learning process more interactive and engaging. I am grateful for the assistance that ChatGPT has provided and I plan to continue utilizing this tool as I further develop my skills.
